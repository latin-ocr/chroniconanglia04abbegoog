the greater part of it is edited so incorrectly that
every two nr three lines present an error, osten a.
grave one.

oi* the manuscript preserved in the British Museum,
which is in a vvn'ting of the thirteenth century.
A few notes have been added, intended partly
as popular illustrations oi* the historical allusions,
and partly to explain the language or the variatione
