Pam-ace. 15

ing to the cause οἱ the Danish invasion of 867.
It is printed in the notes to Pau-ie‘s edition from a
manuscript in the library of Corpus Christi college,
Cambridge, and is here repn'nted from Pettie. The
manuscript from which it is taken (MS, C. C. C.
Cant. No. 139) is said to be οἱ the twelfth century.
The third and last article of the appendix is a
new edition of the now well known life of the Sax-
on Hereward. The first edition was published in
‘the Chroniques Anglo-Normandes in 1839, and was
edited from a transcript in the library oi* Trinity
Coilege, Cambridge, made for Gale the antiqmry,
from the original which is still preserved among the
rnuniments of Peterborough Cathedral. I have
not had an opportunity of examining the original
manuscript, which 1 am told is in parts very diffi-
cult to read ; the transcript at Cambridge is certainly
often incorrect, especially in the earlier part, which,
since the first edition was printed, has been care-
fully collated with the original. The remainder
has been revised from the edition in the Chroniques
Anglo-Norrnandes.

London, March 25, 1850. Tflonus Wmonr.
